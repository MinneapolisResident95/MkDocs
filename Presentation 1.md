## Overview

This presentation reiterated that people are bombarded with more information than ever before each day. The average person is hit with approximately 105,000 words a day. That’s 23 words every second in a twelve-hour day which adds up to roughly 34 gigabytes of data. The writer's goal is to capitalize on the user’s 50 bits per second. If you are legally obligated to share certain information, then jargon and complex sentences are acceptable, but otherwise try to avoid them. People should know when they’re about to engage with dense material.

## Reflection

This presentation connected with a bunch of the Redish text in regards to user accessibility and usefulness. They both gave identical advice in many instances, especially for visual design and how to structure headers and lists in a way that didn't detract from comprehension. The LavaCon presenters were adamant that users do not inherently value your work and they were cynical about users' motives as well. They felt that content creators should assume people are lazy or are overwhelmed with information each day. They used this notion as the foundation for their argument to implore technical communicators to make their content stand out. Redish did much of the same, but implored us to use strong rhetorical components and website design, so as not to inhibit the user experience. Since users are given so much content, it's imperative that you don't shoot yourself in the foot.
