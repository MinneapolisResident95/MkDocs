# Presentation 3: Building Content, Building Success
**Summarized by your dear companion Cal U'Ren**

## Overview

This presentation followed the National Center for Construction Education and Research (NCCR). The organization is based in Florida and describes itself as *effectively the gold standard in construction education and certification.* Global demand drove them to consider how they were publishing. All sorts of markets desperately needed their information to bring discipline and predictability to their trades.

> “This is non trivial. It’s good that someone does it and that someone does it well.” - Joe Gollner, the keynote speaker.

Through these investments, NCCR is trying to get ahead of the curve by developing processes that introduce a lightweight CMS that delivers process facilitation and asset revision control. They needed to be more nimble and to be able to adapt with a lightweight approach to content management.

## Key Takeaways

The global market is increasingly demanding more output, making production and automation more important than ever. This forces organizations to scale up and requires them to be more nimble and adapt. Large companies cannot be siloed; they need a lightweight approach to content management. Through these investments, NCCR is trying to get ahead of the curve by developing processes that deliver strong facilitation and asset revision control. Similarly sized organizations in disparate industries would be served well by following a similar approach. Joe Gollner, the speaker, sums it up well: “Shorter cycles, better adaptation, faster delivery.”

## Reflection

NCCR's approach to content management demonstrates the value behind using the correct tools for specific tasks. Frequently, we use what is familiar or convenient, yet there are countless digital tools that are best suited for what people need to accomplish. In this class, I've learned how different coding languages can enhance website design. By blending knowledge of different languages into one final product you have more freedom to implement content in a rhetorical manner. You are no longer limited in how you present information, which is crucial for user credibility and usefulness. For example, diving right into Adobe XD before consulting with users might not be a sound approach. You also might want to build a website's structure through markdown first, before transitioning to HTML, thus saving yourself a significant chunk of time. If there are lots of tables, lists or other elements that necessitate time, then you want to use the tools that streamline your workflow.
