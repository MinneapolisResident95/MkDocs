# Presentation 2: Beyond Inclusion: The Importance of Accessible Web Content and Design

**Summarized by yours truly, Cal U'Ren**

## Overview

The majority of websites are not Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) compliant. This is problematic since there are 22 million working-age adults in the US with disabilities. That’s an immense number of underserved individuals with a lot of buying power. There are also many people who would benefit from WCAG compliance outside of the disabled:

- People who use small screens
- Aging population
- Folks with temporary disabilities
- Situational limitations (Examples: bright sunlight, contrasting colors)

## Key Takeaways

When tackling WCAG compliance, the speaker recommended a few parameters to work around. Here is the “getting started” with accessibility checklist.

- Choose a conformance level
- Audit a segment of your website
- Publish an accessibility statement

A few simple suggestions from “Beyond Inclusion: The Importance of Accessible Web Content and Design” that every web designer could easily implement.

- Create “alt attributes” that are appropriate
- Have enough contrast between backgrounds, buttons and texts. Don’t hamper the user experience. Meet the standards for accessibility.
- **Video:** Don’t allow auto-play
- **Links:** Avoid “click here” and “learn more” - similar advice to our Redish readings!
- **Be specific:** Use anchor text that’s clear outside of context

## Reflection

This extends our previous work with the MN Healey Club and their unique user group containing old people with poor eyesight and low technological literacy. Our group discussed how this impacted web design but did not approach the issue with WCAG guidelines in mind. In fact, we had no idea they even existed, which seems to be the real issue. Knowing which standard of WCAG compliance we hoped to achieve would've been a strong goal to work towards from the inception of our project. It also would've made a *huge* difference for all of the Club's users! I believe WCAG compliance should've been something that was discussed in Dr. Card's initial meeting with Daphne to establish parameters for us as we worked. I'm not sure how to make WCAG guidelines more prominent in technical communication, but it seems that it could only help.
