# **WRIT 5662 Lightweight Docs Assignment**

I began my journey into markdown with Dr. Card's [GitHub website](https://danieljcard1.github.io/writ-dt/explainers/markdown/), which gave me a *comprehensive* overview of how and why it is used. Next, I watched a few tutorials on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-markdown/what-is-markdown?u=427403560) to gain knowledge about specific features that I was unfamiliar with, such as links, images and line breaks. I was unable to get the blockquotes to work in MkDocs, but it works when I plug it into StackEdit. What shall one do when beleaguered by such trivialities?

## LavaCon 2020 Summary

I thought that there was a very diverse lineup of presentations to choose from. There were even topics that I had never thought of before. Some presentations used real world examples with practical implementation whereas others focused on theory. Personally, I found value in both! I did watch one presentation that was a bit too informal where I tuned out after five minutes. I felt that the speaker was not prepared or should've just read from a script. I'm guessing this was just an isolated incidence, considering the other three presentations I watched were very insightful.
